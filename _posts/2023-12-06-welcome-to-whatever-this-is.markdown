# We're so back?

I've made a few attempts at starting a blog before, but often lost interest. But here's another attempt I guess?

This particular blog is (kindly) hosted by Github on their rather nice and free [Pages][https://pages.github.com/] platform. It's also built using [Jekyll][https://jekyllrb.com], which I highly recommend any of my fellow Markdown enthusiasts check out. 

For anyone interested in Jekyll and so this doesn't become a useless "welcome to my shite blog", here's a really quick rundown of how I'm using/planning to use it;

1. Right out of the box, you get a simple, functional site with a post and an about page.

2. You get a `_posts` directory, with a Markdown file in it. That file is how all your blog posts can look.

3. You get a `_config.yml` file, which is exactly what it sounds like - global settings for your site like Titles. 

4. That's about it, you can make a fully fledged Blog with *just* that and that's more or less how I plan on operating.

So there you have it, that's how simple Jekyll is. Once you have it running, just write some *.md* posts and you're done!
